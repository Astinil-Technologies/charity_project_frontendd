      <h2>ONLINE DONATION FOR NGO INDIA</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2004, Bal Raksha Bharat has been working in several states of India to help
        children get a happy childhood and a bright future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work in close coordination with government agencies at various levels – National,
        State, and District – to run child welfare projects. We work with the aim to support
        and contribute towards the Government of India’s vision to build a “Bharat” where
        children are well-nurtured, with full opportunities for growth and development in a
        safe and protective environment. You can help us achieve this vision by choosing to
        donate to NGO initiatives that focus on child welfare and empowerment.
